"""
Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.

Prototype: def safe_print_list_integers(my_list=[], x=0):
my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
All integers have to be printed on thesame linefollowed by a
    new line - other type of value in the list must be skipped (in silence).
x represents the number of elements to access in my_list
x can be bigger than the length of my_list
               - if itâ€™s the case, an exception is expected to occur
Returns the real number of integers printed
You have to use try: / except:
You have to use "{:d}".format() to print an integer
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use len()
